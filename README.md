# Sentinel 

**Sentinel** is a personal, full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

It is designed as a **discipline-first personal management system** that helps users track and reflect on their daily activities across **academics, health, and personal finance**, all brought together through a **unified calendar view**.

This project focuses on **real-world full-stack architecture**, not just individual features.

---

## 🧭 Project Objective

The objective of Sentinel is to design and implement a **modular, scalable, and realistic full-stack application** that demonstrates:

- Backend API design
- Database schema modeling
- Authentication and authorization
- Frontend–backend integration
- Aggregation of data across multiple domains

The application emphasizes **tracking reality over planning**, helping users understand consistency, discipline, and patterns over time.
